## üß± Foundational Java Concepts for DSA

Before diving into the world of Data Structures and Algorithms with Java, it's essential to have a solid grasp of core Java concepts. Here's a prioritized list with estimated time commitments to help you get started:

| Concept                         | Weightage (Importance for DSA) | Estimated Time (Beginner) | Key Areas to Focus On                                                                  |
| :------------------------------ | :-----------------------------: | :------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Basic Syntax & Data Types** |               High (5/5)      |                   5-7 Hours | Variables, primitive data types, operators, control flow (if/else, loops), methods.   |
| **2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** |               High (5/5)      |                  10-15 Hours | Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction.             |
| **3. Arrays & Collections Framework** |               High (5/5)      |                   8-12 Hours | Understanding `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and their usage.     |
| **4. Exception Handling** |            Medium-High (4/5)      |                   4-6 Hours | `try-catch-finally` blocks, understanding common exception types.                     |
| **5. Generics** |            Medium-High (4/5)      |                   3-5 Hours | Understanding type parameters and their benefits in creating reusable code.           |
| **6. Recursion** |            Medium-High (4/5)      |                   4-6 Hours | Understanding recursive functions and their application in algorithms.               |
| **7. Basic Input/Output** |              Medium (3/5)      |                   2-3 Hours | Reading from and writing to the console (though less critical for core DSA).          |

**Total Estimated Time for Foundational Java:** 36-54 Hours

**Learning Schedule Suggestion (Adaptable):**

This is a sample 4-week schedule assuming you dedicate approximately 10-15 hours per week to learning Java fundamentals. Adjust it based on your learning pace and availability.

**Week 1: Java Basics & OOP Fundamentals (10-15 Hours)**

* Focus on basic syntax, data types, operators, and control flow.
* Introduction to classes, objects, and the core principles of OOP (encapsulation, abstraction).

**Week 2: Inheritance & Polymorphism (10-15 Hours)**

* Deep dive into inheritance, understanding `extends` and the "is-a" relationship.
* Explore polymorphism through method overloading and overriding.

**Week 3: Arrays & Collections Framework (10-15 Hours)**

* Master the use of basic arrays in Java.
* Introduction and practical application of `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`.

**Week 4: Collections (Maps & Sets), Exception Handling, and Generics (10-15 Hours)**

* Learn about `HashMap` and `HashSet` for efficient data storage and retrieval.
* Understand how to handle exceptions gracefully using `try-catch-finally`.
* Introduction to generics for type safety and code reusability.

**Ongoing:** Continuously practice coding examples and small projects to solidify your understanding of these Java fundamentals.
