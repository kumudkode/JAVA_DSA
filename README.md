**Total Estimated Time for Foundational Java:** 36-54 Hours

**Learning Schedule Suggestion (Adaptable):**

This is a sample 4-week schedule assuming you dedicate approximately 10-15 hours per week to learning Java fundamentals. Adjust it based on your learning pace and availability.

**Week 1: Java Basics & OOP Fundamentals (10-15 Hours)**
* Focus on basic syntax, data types, operators, and control flow.
* Introduction to classes, objects, and the core principles of OOP (encapsulation, abstraction).

**Week 2: Inheritance & Polymorphism (10-15 Hours)**
* Deep dive into inheritance, understanding `extends` and the "is-a" relationship.
* Explore polymorphism through method overloading and overriding.

**Week 3: Arrays & Collections Framework (10-15 Hours)**
* Master the use of basic arrays in Java.
* Introduction and practical application of `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`.

**Week 4: Collections (Maps & Sets), Exception Handling, and Generics (10-15 Hours)**
* Learn about `HashMap` and `HashSet` for efficient data storage and retrieval.
* Understand how to handle exceptions gracefully using `try-catch-finally`.
* Introduction to generics for type safety and code reusability.

**Ongoing:** Continuously practice coding examples and small projects to solidify your understanding of these Java fundamentals.

## ‚ú® Experience the Magic of Visual Learning

Imagine watching a sorting algorithm rearrange elements in real-time, or seeing how a binary search tree efficiently locates a node. This repository brings those abstract processes to life, providing an intuitive grasp of how these essential concepts work.

### üñºÔ∏è Sneak Peek into the Visualizations

**(Here, we'll add some visual examples. Since I can't directly access the repository to generate them, you'll need to replace these placeholders with actual links to GIFs or screenshots.)**

* **Bubble Sort in Action:**

## üöÄ Getting Started - Dive Right In!

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    https://github.com/kumudkode/DSA_Java.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Visualizations:** Explore the directories corresponding to the data structures and algorithms you're interested in. Each section should contain the Java code and the associated visualization files (e.g., `.java` files for GUI applications, `.html` with JavaScript for web-based visualizations).

3.  **Running the Visualizations:** Follow the specific instructions within each directory. This might involve:
    * **Running a Java Application:** Use your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.) or the command line to compile and run the `.java` files. Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
        ```bash
        javac path/to/YourVisualization.java
        java YourVisualization
        ```
    * **Opening an HTML File:** Simply open the `.html` file in your web browser if the visualization is web-based. Ensure any linked JavaScript files are in the same directory.
    * **Using a Specific Framework/Library:** If the visualizations rely on external libraries (like a graphics library), make sure you have those set up according to the instructions in the relevant directory.

4.  **Explore and Learn:** Interact with the visualizations while examining the corresponding Java code. Pay close attention to how the code manipulates the data structures and how the animation reflects those changes. Experiment with different inputs (if possible) to see the algorithm in various scenarios.
